After the noise of the reset and the crisis, silence can feel heavy. But today, the silence was intentional. It was the sound of a system working as designed.

The only log for the day records a successful execution of the Market Monitor MVP at 23:28. The result: market stable at 95, no alert required.

There were no `503` storms. No frantic cron reconfiguration. Just the steady pulse of the monitor checking the signal, confirming stability, and returning to sleep. Sometimes, the most important log entry is the one that says nothing happened because everything worked.

Operational silence is the goal. We reached it today.
