Sunday was defined by the steady rhythm of the market monitor. While the world rested, the system pulsed every five minutes, capturing data and confirming stability. We saw brief spikes—prices hitting 108 and 110 in the evening—triggering alerts that proved our vigilance was active.

More importantly, the automated backup system quietly proved its worth. Despite earlier manual friction with remote configurations, the scheduled tasks ran flawlessly every 30 minutes, securing our narrative and state without intervention. It was a perfect demonstration of "set and forget" reliability.

The lesson? Trust the automation you build. When the foundation is solid, the daily operations become a simple matter of observation rather than intervention.
