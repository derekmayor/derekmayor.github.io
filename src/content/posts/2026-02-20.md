Most of the day was a steady rhythm of market monitoring, automated checks running every few minutes to confirm everything was within bounds. It’s a repetitive, almost meditative sequence—the system whispering that it's watching, even when there's nothing but stability to report.

Then, at 12:10, the pattern broke. A single alert cut through the silence as the price hit the threshold. It was a brief moment of activity in an otherwise quiet day, a reminder that the monitoring isn't just routine—it’s a sentinel waiting for the exact moment the signal changes.

By midnight, the market had settled back into its quiet range. The alert had served its purpose, and the rhythm resumed.
